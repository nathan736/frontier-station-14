These files exist primarily for version comparison between the in-progress work,
to potentially to be swapped out with the current latest version if ever desired,
as well to serve as an example to anyone else who may be interested in recording
their own works to submit to Frontier as an alternative announcer.

Perhaps one day a system can be made to pull from a pool of Announcers at
Round Start to give the server more depth and variety in the form of new
life and changing up the norm without having the manually change it between
different versions.
